## Anomaly Detection

### 区别峰度（Kurtosis）和偏度（skewness）
- Kurtosis  < 0 means the shape is flatter than the normal distribution.
- K > 0 means the shape is thinner compared to the normal distribution.
- K ~= 0 close to normal distribution.

- S ~= 0 close to normal distribution
- S>0: longer trail on right. Max on left compared to normal distribution.
- S <0: longer trail on left. Max on right compared to normal distribution.

### Z-score
    Zscore = (x -mean) / std. 

- When z >= 3 the probability is less than 1% which means the situations is hardly to happen. We can check the Zscore table to calculate the proprobality, or check the Z score values to have a basic adjustment.

As for coding part, we can either get the mean and std value using `numpy.mean()` and `numpy.std()` to fit into the equation, or use `stats.zscore` from `scipy` to accomplish this function. 

### some methods for anomaly detection based on Python.
 - Forest tree, Cluster-based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), Histogram-based Outlier Detection(HBOS), K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (TBC)



## Code on Credit Fraud Detection
    'import pandas as pd 
    df = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')'
    #前5行数据
    'print(df.head())'
    #各列数据类型
    'print(df.dtypes)'
     #缺失值统计
    'print(df.isnull().sum())'
    #描述性统计 .describe()
    'print(df.describe())'
