## Anomaly Detection

### 区别峰度（Kurtosis）和偏度（skewness）
- Kurtosis  < 0 means the shape is flatter than the normal distribution.
- K > 0 means the shape is thinner compared to the normal distribution.
- K ~= 0 close to normal distribution.

- S ~= 0 close to normal distribution
- S>0: longer trail on right. Max on left compared to normal distribution.
- S <0: longer trail on left. Max on right compared to normal distribution.

### some methods for anomaly detection based on Python.
 - Forest tree, Cluster-based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), Histogram-based Outlier Detection(HBOS), K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (TBC)
