## Anomaly Detection

### 区别峰度（Kurtosis）和偏度（skewness）
- Kurtosis  < 0 means the shape is flatter than the normal distribution.
- K > 0 means the shape is thinner compared to the normal distribution.
- K ~= 0 close to normal distribution.

- S ~= 0 close to normal distribution
- S>0: longer trail on right. Max on left compared to normal distribution.
- S <0: longer trail on left. Max on right compared to normal distribution.

### Z-score
    Zscore = (x -mean) / std. 

- When z >= 3 the probability is less than 1% which means the situations is hardly to happen. We can check the Zscore table to calculate the proprobality, or check the Z score values to have a basic adjustment.

As for coding part, we can either get the mean and std value using `numpy.mean()` and `numpy.std()` to fit into the equation, or use `stats.zscore` from `scipy` to accomplish this function. 

### some methods for anomaly detection based on Python.
 - Forest tree, Cluster-based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), Histogram-based Outlier Detection(HBOS), K - Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (TBC)



## Code on Credit Fraud Detection

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
# 整体特征（variable个数，每个variable个数，格式）  
df.info()
# 描述性统计  
df.describe()
# 缺失值统计
df.isnull().sum()
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

feature = 'V1'  # 换成你想看的特征

plt.figure(figsize=(15,4))

plt.subplot(1,3,1)
sns.histplot(df[feature], kde=True, color='skyblue')
plt.title(f'Histogram of {feature}')

plt.subplot(1,3,2)
sns.boxplot(x=df[feature], color='lightgreen')
plt.title(f'Boxplot of {feature}')

plt.subplot(1,3,3)
sns.violinplot(x=df[feature], color='lightpink')
plt.title(f'Violin plot of {feature}')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

plt.figure(figsize=(12,10))
corr = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, cmap='coolwarm', center=0, annot=False)
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

n_features = len(df.columns) - 1
for i in range(n_features):
    cur_feature = df.iloc[:, i]
    cur_zscore = stats.zscore(cur_feature)
    abnormal_idx = np.where(np.abs(cur_zscore) > 3)
    print(f"Feature {i} has {len(abnormal_idx[0])} outliers based on Z-score.")
