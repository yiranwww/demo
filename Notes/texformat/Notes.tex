\section{Test}
To calibrate the camera, we can use a checkerboard pattern. The checkerboard
pattern shall not be square so that the pattern contains two black corners on
one side and two white corners on the opposite side. This helps to determine
the orientation of the pattern. The calibrator assigns the longer side as
x-direction. In our case, we download 20 images and numbered them. The size of
the checkboard pattern we used is $14\times 13$, so the coordinate set as the
form $13 \times 12$-$x y$ coordinate.
